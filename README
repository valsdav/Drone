To compile:
===========

cmake .
make

To simulate a drone:
===================
./drone angleX angleY omegaX omegaY stepForce NstepTimeForCorrection stepTimeSimulation totalTime output_filename

To view the results:
====================
./print-drone column1 column2 ... ... filename


Example:
=======
Simulate a drone with angleX = 20 at the beginning with a correction of 3*stepForce
every 0.1 s = 10* 0.01  for 30 seconds.

./drone 20 0 0 0 3 10 0.01 30 data
./print-drone angleX posZ velZ velX FtotX data



==================
| Python version |
==================

To run:
======
Insert: angle_X angle_Y omega_X omega_Y dF dTcorrection dTsimulation seconds name
Where:
- angle_X:      starting angle around X axis
- angle_Y:      starting angle around Y axis
- omega_X:      starting angular speed around X axis
- omega_Y:      starting angular speed around Y axis
- dF:           correction step applied to engines power
- dTcorrection: time in seconds between two engines corrections
- dTsimulation: not used (but value required)
- seconds:      simulated run time in seconds
- name:         output file name

Example:
=======
python SimulationDrone.py 20 0 0 0 3 0.1 999 3 data
